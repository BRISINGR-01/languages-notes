Agreement
Portuguese possessive adjectives agree in gender (i.e. masc. or fem.) and number (i.e. sing. or plur.) with the thing possessed:
| o meu chapéu | my hat |
| --- | --- |
| o nosso carro | our car |
| a minha mala | my suitcase |
| os meus sapatos | my shoes |
| as nossas luvas | our gloves |
Alternative forms for second- and third-person possessors
Since the third-person forms seu(s) / sua(s) may mean his, hers, theirs or yours, alternatives are often used to clarify who the owner is. So, particularly in speech, constructions consisting of the preposition decontracted with a third person subject pronoun, ele(s) / ela(s), are frequently used to indicate third-person possessors:
| o chapéu dela (= de + ela) | her hat |
| --- | --- |
| o carro dele (= de + ele) | his car |
| as malas delas (= de + elas) | their suitcases |
Portuguese usage of possessive adjectives compared with English
Unlike in English, possessive adjectives are not used with parts of the body, articles of clothing or other personal belongings, close relations or friends, etc, when the possessor is also the subject of the sentence and the connection is obvious.
| Ela cruzou os braços. | She folded her arms. |
| --- | --- |
| O cachorro abanou o rabo. | The little dog wagged his tail. |
| Eu perdi os óculos. | I have lost my spectacles. |
| Ela deixou a bolsa no carro. | She left her purse in the car. |
| A mãe levou os filhos para a praia. | The mother took her children to the beach. |
| Eles perderam o juízo. | They have lost their minds. |
