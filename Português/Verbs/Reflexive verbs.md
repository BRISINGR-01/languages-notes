Reflexive verbs - Easy Learning Grammar Portuguese
 
A reflexive verb is one that is accompanied by a reflexive pronoun to show that the subject both performs and receives the action (e.g. I washed myself).
| lavar-se | to wash oneself |
| --- | --- |
| reflexive pronouns |
| --- |
|   | singular | plural |
| 1st person | me | myself | nos | ourselves |
| 2nd person | se (general) te (familiar) | yourself | se (both general and familiar) | yourselves |
| 3rd person | se | him/her/itself | se | themselves |
| Ele ainda não se lavou. | He hasn’t washed (himself) yet. or He hasn’t had a wash yet. |
| --- | --- |
| Elas ainda não se lavaram. | They (fem.) haven’t washed (themselves) yet. |
When conjugating a reflexive verb, in Brazilian Portuguese the reflexive pronoun comes before the verb; in European Portuguese it also comes before the verb in negative sentences and in sentences with an interrogative word, but it comes after the verb (linked with a hyphen) in affirmative sentences:
| Ele lavou-se. (Eur), Ele se lavou. (Br) | He washed (himself). |
| --- | --- |
| Ele não se lavou. (Eur) (Br) | He didn’t wash (himself). |
| Quando é que ele se lavou? (Eur) (Br) | When did he wash (himself)? |
In the first person plural, when the reflexive pronoun comes after the verb, the final -s of the verb is dropped:
| Nós lavamo-nos. (lavamos + nos) (Eur) | We wash (ourselves). |
| --- | --- |
 
Portuguese reflexives also express reciprocity:
| Eles beijam-se. (Eur), Eles se beijam. (Br) | They kiss (each other). |
| --- | --- |
| Nós encontramo-nos às quinze. (Eur),
Nós nos encontramos às quinze. (Br) | We’ll meet at 3 p.m. |
In fact, reflexive constructions are used much more extensively in Portuguese than in English, where other constructions tend to be used instead:
| Como é que você se chama? (Eur) (Br) | What’s your name? |
| --- | --- |
| Eu chamo-me… (Eur), Eu me chamo… (Br) | My name is…. (literally: I call myself…) |
