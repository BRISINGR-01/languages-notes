Questions for yes/no replies
Unlike English, in Portuguese there is no subject-verb inversion or auxiliary required. Simply turn a statement into a question by using a rising intonation at the end of the sentence. The normal word order is generally followed and the question is indicated only by the intonation of the voice:
| O jantar foi bom? | Was dinner good? |
| --- | --- |
| Você vai para a praia? | Are you going to the beach? |
| Eles já chegaram? | Have they arrived yet? |
| Você fala Português? | Do you speak Portuguese? |
For the answer:
You can reply with Sim, Yes, or Não, No. However, particularly in affirmative replies, native speakers tend to repeat elements from the question while changing the verb ending as required:
| O jantar foi bom? | Was dinner good? |
| --- | --- |
| Não, não foi. | No, it wasn’t. |
| Você fala Português. | Do you speak Portuguese? |
| Falo, sim. | Yes, I do. |
 
Questions beginning with an interrogative word
Except for Como…?, How…? and Quanto…?, How much …?, Portuguese question words usually have a Wh- word counterpart in English:
| Que rua é esta? | What street is this? |
| --- | --- |
| Quem veio aqui ontem? | Who came here yesterday? |
| De quem é aquele passaporte? | Whose passport is that? |
| Onde estão as chaves? | Where are the keys? |
| Quanto tempo vai demorar? | How long is it going to take? |
| Como se diz isso em Português? | How do you say that in Portuguese? |
See also Interrogative adjectives, and Interrogative pronouns.
When a subject word is present, inversion may or may not occur without there being any change in meaning, regardless of which side of the Atlantic you are on:
| Que livro você comprou? or Que livro comprou você? | What book did you buy? |
| --- | --- |
However, if the expression é que is used, word order follows a subject + verb sequence:
| Que livro é que você comprou? | What book did you buy? |
| --- | --- |
A special question word in Brazil is Cadê…? or Quedê…?. It derives from the expression Que é feito de…? (What has become of …?) and is used meaning Where is…?:
| Cadê o teu irmão? (Coll Br) | Where’s your brother? |
| --- | --- |
| Que é feito do teu irmão? (Eur) (Wr Br) | What has become of your brother? |
 
Tag questions
To make a tag question, you can leave the sentence as it is and simply repeat the verb at the end:
| Ele comprou um computador novo, não comprou? | He’s bought a new computer, hasn’t he? |
| --- | --- |
However, a more widely heard alternative is the use of a phrase like não?, não é?, não é verdade? at the end:
| Ele comprou um computador novo, não é? | He’s bought a new computer, hasn’t he? |
| --- | --- |
