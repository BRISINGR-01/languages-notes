Tu, você and o senhor / a senhora - Easy Learning Grammar Portuguese
 
 
Saying you in Portuguese
In today’s English, there is an all-embracing pronoun used for addressing people: you.
The closest Portuguese translation is você:
| Você está de férias? | Are you on holiday? (addressing one person) |
| --- | --- |
In Portuguese, a more formal form of address is achieved by replacing você with the nouns o senhor (literally, the gentleman) and a senhora (the lady), when wishing to show more respect:
| O senhor está de férias? | Are you on holiday? |
| --- | --- |
| A senhora está de férias? | Are you on holiday? |
In Portuguese, a less formal approach can be achieved by using tu,and its related forms te and ti,but there is variation in practice.
In Portugal, including Madeira and the Azores, as well as in Portuguese-speaking regions of Africa and Asia, tu is the main choice for this purpose, along with its related object pronouns, te and ti:
| Tu estás de férias? | Are you on holiday? |
| --- | --- |
| Eu não te vi na praia. (Eur) | I didn’t see you on the beach. |
In Brazil, there is a general preference for você in conjunction with the object pronouns te and ti, though tu can also be heard:
| Você está de férias? | Are you on holiday? |
| --- | --- |
| Eu não te vi na praia. (Br) | I didn’t see you on the beach. |
When talking to more than one person, você is pluralized to vocês.
| Vocês estão de férias? | Are you on holiday? |
| --- | --- |
The nouns are pluralized to os senhores (the gentlemen) or as senhoras (the ladies).
A masculine plural can refer to a pair or group that includes both genders:
| As senhoras estão de férias? | Are you on holiday (ladies)? |
| --- | --- |
| Os senhores estão de férias? | Are you (addressing men and women) on holiday? |
Where tu is used in the singular, vocês is used in the plural:
| Vocês estão de férias? | Are you on holiday? |
| --- | --- |
 
Verb agreement for you
The verb endings used for both the more formal o senhor / a senhora and less formal você are third-person forms:
| O senhor está de férias? | Are you on holiday? |
| --- | --- |
| Você está de férias? | Are you on holiday? |
In Portugal, and the other geographical locations listed above, the subject pronoun tu has retained its traditional second-person singular verb endings. Because they are distinctive as a second-person marker, tu can be omitted without loss of meaning:
| Tu estás de férias? (Eur) or Estás de férias? | Are you on holiday? |
| --- | --- |
In Brazil, when the subject pronoun tu is used, it is often conjugated with third-person verb endings, like você. This is particularly the case in the north-east and in some areas on the Atlantic coast:
| Tu está de férias? (Coll Br) (regionally) | Are you on holiday? |
| --- | --- |
When talking to more than one person, third-person plural verb endings are used in modern Portuguese whatever the subject marker, whether it is vocês (plural to both você and tu) or os senhores / as senhoras:
| Vocês estão de férias? | Are you on holiday? |
| --- | --- |
| Os senhores estão de férias? | Are you on holiday? |
When unsure which form of address to use, you can just use a third-person verb ending without a subject pronoun or other marker. This is heard on both sides of the Atlantic but more so in Portugal:
| Está de férias? | Are you on holiday?
(addressing one person) |
| --- | --- |
| Estão de férias? | Are you on holiday?
(addressing more than one person) |
