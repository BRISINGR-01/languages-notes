Gender guidelines
There are some guidelines that can help you work out whether a noun is masculine or feminine.
By meaning
Generally, males and females are masculine and feminine respectively:
| homem (masculine) / mulher (feminine) | man / woman |
| --- | --- |
| cavalo (masculine) / égua (feminine) | horse / mare |
| gato (masculine) / gata (feminine) | cat / she-cat |
By word ending
Usually masculine: nouns ending in the vowels -o and -u, the consonants -l, -r, and -z, and the letters -ume:
gato livro peru hotel mar rapaz legume
Usually feminine: nouns ending in the vowel -a and the letters -gem, -dade, -tude and -ão (when the ending corresponds to -ion in the English translation):
gata escola garagem identidade juventude atenção
However, since there are exceptions, it is always advisable to learn a noun with its definite article, i.e., the word for the, which indicates its gender. Please see The definite article.
Some nouns have only one gender, often feminine, which applies to both male and female. The following nouns are always feminine even when they refer to a male:
pessoa criança testemunha vítima
A masculine plural can cover both genders:
| irmão | brother | irmãos | brothers or brother(s) and sister(s) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| senhor | gentleman | senhores | gentlemen or ladies and gentlemen |
