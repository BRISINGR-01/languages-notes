The definite article - Easy Learning Grammar Portuguese
 
The Portuguese definite article agrees in gender (i.e. masc. or fem.) and number (i.e. sing. or plur.) with the noun to which it relates. As such, it has the following forms:
| o | masculine singular | os | masculine plural |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a | feminine singular | as | feminine plural |
| o homem | the man | os homens | the men |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a chave | the key | as chaves | the keys |
(Please note that Portuguese a translates English the, not a/an.)
Where the noun would otherwise be ambiguous as to gender or number, the article provides clarification:
| o estudante | the male student | a estudante | the female student |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| o artista | the male artist | a artista | the female artist |
| o lápis | the pencil | os lápis | the pencils |
See Formation of feminines, and Formation of plurals.
For nouns that mean different things depending on their gender, it is the article that helps identify the sense in question:
| o capital | capital (money) | a capital | capital (city) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| o guia | guide book | a guia | bill of lading; advice slip |
See Gender of nouns.
Basically the role of the definite article is much the same in Portuguese as it is in English, but its use is broader in Portuguese.
