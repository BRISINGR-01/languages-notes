Simple tenses: formation - Easy Learning Grammar Portuguese
 
In Portuguese, the following are simple tenses: present; preterite; imperfect; future; conditional; imperative; present subjunctive; imperfect subjunctive; future subjunctive.
These simple tenses are formed by adding endings to a verb stem. The endings show the number and person of the subject of the verb:
| Eu canto. | I sing. |
| --- | --- |
| Nós cantamos. | We sing. |
| Ele comerá. | He will eat. |
| Eles comerão. | They will eat. |
 
Second-person verb forms
Third-person endings for você and vocês: even though você and vocês mean you (singular and plural), for historical reasons they are used with third-person verb endings.
| Você canta. | You sing. |
| --- | --- |
| Ele canta. | He sings. |
| Vocês comem. | You eat. (plural) |
| Eles comem. | They eat. |
In the verb tables, these endings will be identified as: 2nd, 3rd person.
Traditional second-person endings: these are for subjects tu and vós, which also mean you (singular and plural).
| Tu cantas. | You sing. |
| --- | --- |
| Vós cantais. | You sing. (plural) |
Singular endings for tu will be shown separately in the verb tables, identified as: 2nd person. Plural endings for vós will also appear, but in brackets, as they are no longer in current use.
For information on the different ways of saying you in Portuguese see tu, você, and o senhor / a senhora on Tu, você and o senhor / a senhora.
 
Regular verbs
The stem and endings of regular verbs are predictable. The verb tables in the following sections show the patterns for regular verbs. For irregular verbs see Irregular verbs onwards.
There are three regular verb patterns (known as conjugations), each identifiable by the ending of the infinitive:
First conjugation verbs end in -ar, e.g. cantar to sing.
Second conjugation verbs end in -er, e.g. comer to eat.
Third conjugation verbs end in -ir, e.g. partir to leave, depart.
These three conjugations are explained on the following pages.
 
Infinitives ending in -ôr and -or
Pôr, meaning to put, place, is irregular even in the infinitive. Its endings are shown in the tables for irregular verbs. These endings also apply to its compounds, e.g. compor to compose, organize; dispor to arrange; impor to impose; opor to oppose. Note the absence of written accent ô in the compounds.
