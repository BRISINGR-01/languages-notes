Agreement
Portuguese possessive pronouns agree in gender and number with the thing possessed:
| o meu (=chapéu) | mine (= hat) |
| --- | --- |
| o nosso (= carro) | ours (= car) |
| a minha (= mala) | mine (= suitcase) |
| os meus (= sapatos) | mine (= shoes) |
| as nossas (= luvas) | ours (= gloves) |
 
Alternative forms for second- and third-person possessors
Since the third-person forms seu(s) / sua(s) could mean his, hers, theirs or yours, alternatives are often used to clarify who the owner is. So, particularly in speech, constructions consisting of the preposition de contracted with a third person subject pronoun, ele(s) / ela(s), are frequently used to indicate third-person possessors:
| o dela (= de + ela) | (chapéu, hat) | hers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| o dele (= de + ele) | (carro, car) | his |
| as delas (= de + elas) | (malas, suitcases) | theirs |
(For contracted forms see also Prepositions.)
This same technique can be applied to the second person, with the preposition de followed by the subject-marker word(s):
| a de você (less heard than a sua) | (mala, suitcase) | yours |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a do senhor | (mala, suitcase) | yours |
| a do João (Coll Eur) | (mala, suitcase) | yours |
| as das senhoras | (malas, suitcases) | yours |
 
Omission of o / a
With one-word possessives (meu, seu, teu, nosso, vosso, etc), o(s) / a(s) is omitted when the possessive stands alone (normally after the verb ser) except when being emphatic about who something belongs to:
| De quem é aquela mala? | Whose suitcase is that? |
| --- | --- |
| É minha. but | Aquela mala é a minha. |
| It’s mine. | That suitcase is mine. (no one else’s) |
