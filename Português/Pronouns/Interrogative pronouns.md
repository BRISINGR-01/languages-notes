Interrogative pronouns - Easy Learning Grammar Portuguese
 
Quem…? translates English Who…? and Whom…?, both singular and plural:
| Quem veio aqui ontem? | Who came here yesterday? |
| --- | --- |
De quem…? translates English Whose…?, but, unlike the English construction, it has to be followed by a verb rather than a noun:
| De quem é este passaporte? | Whose passport is this? |
| --- | --- |
Que…? and Qual…? are equivalent to What? and Which? in English.
Que…? is used when the questioner is expecting an answer that identifies or defines.
Qual…? (plural Quais…?) is used when the possible answers are more restricted and there is an implicit idea of choice:
| Qual você prefere? | Which do you prefer? (choosing one out of two or more options) |
| --- | --- |
| Quais você prefere? | Which do you prefer? (choosing more than one out of a limited range of possibilities) |
Quanto…?, Quanta…?, Quantos…?, Quantas…? corresponds to How much?, How many? in English and agrees in gender and number with the noun:
| Quanto custa? | How much does it cost? |
| --- | --- |
| Quantas são? | How many are there? |
