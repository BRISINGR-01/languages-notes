Simple tenses: third conjugation - Easy Learning Grammar Portuguese
 
For all tenses other than the future, the conditional and the future subjunctive, the stem is formed removing ir from the infinitive. To this stem, we add the appropriate endings for each person, as shown in the table below. The stem of the future, the conditional and the future subjunctive is the same as the infinitive.
