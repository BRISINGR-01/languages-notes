Demonstrative pronouns - Easy Learning Grammar Portuguese
 
Demonstrative pronouns have forms that agree in gender (i.e masc. or fem.) and number (i.e. sing. or plur.) with the noun they replace:
|   | masculine | feminine |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| singular | este, esse, aquele | esta, essa, aquela | this; that (one) |
| plural | estes, esses, aqueles | estas, essas, aquelas | these; those (ones) |
There are also invariable neuter forms, for something or someone yet to be identified:
| isto, isso, aquilo | this; that (one) |
| --- | --- |
| Este é o meu casaco. | This is my coat. |
| --- | --- |
| Esse é o teu guarda-chuva. | That is your umbrella. |
| Aquelas são as malas deles. | Those are their suitcases. |
| Aquilo parece ser o meu passaporte. | That looks like my passport. |
isto, este (and their feminine and plural forms) are used to indicate something close to the speaker, i.e. to the 1st person.
isso, esse (and their feminine and plural forms) are used to indicate something close to the listener, i.e. to the 2nd person.
aquilo, aquele (and their feminine and plural forms) are used to indicate something at a distance away from both the 1st and 2nd persons.
| Speaker A:   O que é aquilo lá em cima no céu? | What is that up there in the sky? |
| --- | --- |
| Speaker B:   É um helicóptero. | It’s a helicopter. |
| Speaker A:   Aquele helicóptero vai muito alto. | That helicopter is flying rather high. |
The forms isso and esse can translate both that and this:
| Speaker A:   O que é isso? | What is that? (you are holding) |
| --- | --- |
| Speaker B:   É uma caneta. | It’s a pen. |
but
| Speaker A:   Destes dois livros eu prefiro este. | Out of these two books I prefer this one. (the one closer to A) |
| --- | --- |
| Speaker B:   Eu também prefiro esse. | I prefer this / that one too. |
In Brazil, isto and este are not much used in colloquial speech, leaving isso and esse to cover both.
In the word combination o que, o is a demonstrative pronoun – see Relative pronouns.
