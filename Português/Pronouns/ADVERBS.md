Adverbs - Easy Learning Grammar Portuguese
 
 
Adverbs in -mente
In Portuguese, a large number of adverbs are formed by adding -mente to an adjective, very much in the same way as -ly is added to adjectives in English:
| forte | strong | fortemente | strongly |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| feliz | happy | felizmente | happily |
With adjectives that have alternative masculine and feminine endings, -mente is added to the feminine form:
| lindo | beautiful | lindamente | beautifully |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sincero | sincere | sinceramente | sincerely |
The adjective part of the adverb loses its stress to the -mente ending, meaning that written accents disappear:
| cortês | courteous | cortesmente | courteously |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| rápido | quick, fast | rapidamente | quickly |
When two adverbs are used together, normally only the second one takes a -mente ending:
| Ela falou clara e resolutamente. | She spoke clearly and decisively. |
| --- | --- |
| Ele trabalha lenta mas eficientemente. | He works slowly but efficiently. |
 
Other adverbs
Common adverbs of manner include bem, well; mal, badly, poorly; depressa, fast, quickly; devagar, slowly; assim, like this:
| Tudo correu bem. | All went well. |

| Não consigo trabalhar assim. | I can’t work this way. |
Common adverbs of time include agora, now; antes, before; depois, after; ainda, still; sempre, always; nunca, never:

Common adverbs of place include perto, near; longe, far; atrás, behind; debaixo, under; diante, in front, ahead; em cima, above; fora, out; dentro, in; aqui, here; aí, there; ali, there; lá, there:
