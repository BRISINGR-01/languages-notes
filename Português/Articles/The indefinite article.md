The indefinite article - Easy Learning Grammar Portuguese
 
The Portuguese indefinite article agrees with the noun to which it relates. As such it has a masculine and a feminine form:
| um | masculine |
| --- | --- |
| uma | feminine |
| um homem | a man |
| --- | --- |
| uma chave | a key |
The Portuguese indefinite article also has plural forms. These often correspond to some and a few in English:
| uns homens | some / a few men |
| --- | --- |
| umas chaves | some / a few keys |
Portuguese um / uma sometimes corresponds to the English indefinite article a / an and sometimes to the number one. See Cardinal and ordinal numbers. Partly as a result of this, usage varies between the two languages.
Unlike in English, the Portuguese indefinite article is not used:
with a classifying noun, denoting someone’s job, religion, affiliation, age group, etc
| Ela é professora. | She is a teacher. |
| --- | --- |
| Ela é católica. | She is a Catholic. |
| Ele já é adulto. | He is an adult now. |
with hundreds and thousands
| Cem dias é muito tempo. | A hundred days is a long time. |
| --- | --- |
| Este parqueamento tem capacidade para mil veículos. | This car park has space for a thousand vehicles. |
