Conjunctions - Easy Learning Grammar Portuguese
 
Generally, Portuguese and English conjunctions are used in much the same way. However, there are some differences to note.
 
Coordinating conjunctions
As in English, Portuguese coordinating conjunctions join together clauses or groups of words that have a similar status. To talk about alternatives, however, there are two cases in which Portuguese repeats the same connective words whereas English uses different words:
| Ou… ou… | Either… or… |
| --- | --- |
| Nem… nem… | Neither… nor… |
| Ou vocês estudam ou vocês não serão aprovados. | Either you study or you won’t pass your exam. |
| --- | --- |
| Nem ele nem ela vai conseguir isso. | Neither he nor she is going to manage that. |
 
Subordinating conjunctions
As in English, Portuguese subordinating conjunctions link main and subordinate clauses together.
Conjunctions introducing subordinate clauses
se, if or whether
| Sairei se não chover. | I’ll go out if it doesn’t rain. |
| --- | --- |
| Não sei se choverá ou não. | I don’t know whether it will rain or not. |
que, that (but often omitted in English)
| Eu disse que sim. | I said yes. |
| --- | --- |
| Você disse que não. | You said no. |
| Soubemos que ia chover. | We were told (that) it was going to rain. |
| Ninguém sabe que o carro foi vendido. | No one knows (that) the car has been sold. |
The verb in the subordinate clause
After some conjunctions the subjunctive may be needed in the subordinate clause, depending on the time reference and the type of statement involved. This is the case, for instance, with quando, when, and que, that:
| Geralmente faço o café quando eles chegam.
Subordinate clause: present indicative | Usually I make coffee when they arrive. (regular action) |
| --- | --- |
| Vou fazer o café quando eles chegarem.
Subordinate clause: future subjunctive | I’ll make coffee when they arrive. (action in the future) |
Some conjunctions are always followed by a subjunctive in the subordinate clause. This is the case, for example, with conjunctions of concession, condition and purpose:
| Geralmente como isso embora não goste muito.
Subordinate clause: present subjunctive | Usually I eat that although I don’t like it much. (concession) |
| --- | --- |
| Falei com eles para que tudo se fizesse.
Subordinate clause: imperfect subjunctive | I talked to them so that everything would get done. (purpose) |
See Use of tenses, and The subjunctive: when to use it.
