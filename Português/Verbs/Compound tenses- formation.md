Compound tenses: formation - Easy Learning Grammar Portuguese
 
In Portuguese, the following are compound tenses: present perfect; pluperfect; future perfect; conditional perfect; present perfect subjunctive; pluperfect subjunctive; future perfect subjunctive.
Compound tenses consist of the past participle of the verb preceded by an auxiliary verb and are formed the same way for both regular and irregular verbs.
The auxiliary verb is normally ter.
The past participle may be regular or irregular but remains invariable, i.e. it does not change to agree with the subject in gender or number. For past participle formation see Present and past participles.
| Ele tinha cantado. | He had sung. |
| --- | --- |
| Elas tinham cantado. | They (fem.) had sung. |
