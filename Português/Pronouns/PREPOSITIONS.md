Specific cases relating to frequently-used prepositions
There are many subtleties of meaning in the ways prepositions link words together in a language and there are often variations in usage among native speakers from different areas. On top of this, there are differences in how speakers of different languages see connections between words. All this makes prepositions especially prone to mismatches across different languages. For this reason, key distinctions are made below for Portuguese prepositions in relation to English ones. Alternatives are also shown for European usage (Eur), both spoken and written, and for Brazilian usage, spoken (Coll Br) and written (Wr Br), the latter also covering formal speech.
