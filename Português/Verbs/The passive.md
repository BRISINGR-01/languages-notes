The passive - Easy Learning Grammar Portuguese
 
In the passive, the subject receives the action (e.g. I was called) as opposed to performing it (e.g. I called). The Portuguese passive is formed in very much the same way as the English one, i.e. using a form of the verb ser meaning to be, and a past participle:
| Ele foi recompensado. | He was rewarded. |
| --- | --- |
| O carro foi vendido. | The car was sold. |
In the passive in Portuguese, the past participle agrees in gender and number with the subject:
| Elas foram recompensadas. | They (fem.) were rewarded. |
| --- | --- |
| Os carros foram vendidos. | The cars were sold. |
 
The Portuguese se construction as an alternative to the passive
(It performs similarly to a reflexive verb in the third person)
| Fala-se Português. | Portuguese is spoken. |
| --- | --- |
| Alugam-se bicicletas | Bicycles for hire (can be hired). |
The se construction can also have other English translations (you, one, we):
| Como se escreve o seu nome? | How do you spell your name? |
| --- | --- |
| Come-se bem neste restaurante. | You eat well in this restaurant. |
