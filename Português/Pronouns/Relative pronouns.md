Relative pronouns - Easy Learning Grammar Portuguese
 
Que (that, which, who, whom) is the most frequently used relative pronoun in Portuguese. It is invariable and can be used both as subject and direct object:
| O rapaz que veio aqui é meu aluno. | The boy (who or that) came here is a pupil of mine. |
| --- | --- |
| A minha amiga é a pessoa que você vê ali. | My friend is the person (whom or who or that) you can see over there. |
| A caneta que está em cima da mesa é minha. | The pen (that or which) is on the table is mine. |
| Tenho o livro que você pediu. | I have the book (which or that) you asked for. |
(Please note that, unlike English, Portuguese never omits the relative pronoun.)
Quecan be preceded by a preposition, in which case it often translates English which and whom:
| O apartamento em que ela mora é espaçoso. | The apartment in which she lives or that she lives in is spacious. |
| --- | --- |
| A companhia para que ele trabalhava fica fora da cidade. | The company for which he worked is out of town. |
Quem (whom) is often used in preference to que when the relative pronoun refers to a person or people and is the object of the verb. It is invariable:
| A senhora a quem entreguei o livro é a minha professora. | The lady to who or whom I handed the book is my teacher. |
| --- | --- |
| O patrão para quem ele trabalhava já se aposentou. | The boss who he worked for has now retired. or The boss he worked for has now retired. |
O qual, a qual, os quais, as quais (which, who, whom) is a relative pronoun that varies in gender and number with the noun it relates to. It is not used much in conversation:
| O presidente, o qual também é orador, proferiu um discurso. | The president, who is also a good speaker, gave an address. |
| --- | --- |
| São quatro as cidades nas quais ele falou. | There were four cities in which he gave a talk or (that) he gave a talk in. |
| Um homem, o nome do qual desconheço, dirigiu-se ao presidente. | A man, whose name I do not know, approached the president. |
Cujo, cuja, cujos, cujas (whose) is a relative pronoun that functions as an adjective and agrees in gender and number with the noun it accompanies. It provides an alternative to do qual, etc:
| Um homem, cujo nome desconheço, dirigiu-se ao presidente. | A man, whose name I do not know, approached the president. |
| --- | --- |
O que (that which) is a combination of the demonstrative pronoun o and the relative pronoun que. Used as a neuter pronoun, it is often equivalent to that, what or which in English:
| Tudo o que você me disse é verdade. | Everything (that) you told me is true. |
| --- | --- |
| Só aceitarei o que é justo. | I will only accept what is fair. |
| Somos o que somos. | We are what we are. |
| Ela é professora, o que eu não sabia. | She is a teacher, which I didn’t know. |
O que, a que, os que, as que are also options available. In this case the demonstrative pronoun agrees in gender and number with a specific noun and can translate English the one(s); this, these, that, those; he/she/it/they who:
| Você prefere os meus livros ou os que estão na mesa? | Do you prefer my books or the ones / those on the table? |
| --- | --- |
| Na corrida feminina a que chegar primeiro ganhará o troféu. | In the ladies’ race the one or the woman who comes in first will win the trophy. |
The adverbs onde (where) for place and como (how) for manner can also be used as relative pronouns:
| O apartamento onde ela mora é espaçoso. | The apartment where she lives is spacious. |
| --- | --- |
The onde and como options also provide alternatives to qual:
| São quatro as cidades onde ele falou. | There were four cities where he gave a talk. |
| --- | --- |
| instead of |   |
| São quatro as cidades nas quais ele falou. (Wr) | There were four cities in which he gave a talk. |
| A maneira como ele nos tratou é um escândalo. | How he treated us was scandalous. |
| --- | --- |
| instead of |   |
| A maneira pela qual ele nos tratou é um escândalo. (Wr) | The way (in which) he treated us was scandalous. |
