The Portuguese present participle (or gerund) is not used as much as the English -ing forms but has a similar role in two main situations.
To express the circumstances (time, cause, etc) surrounding an action or event:
| Partindo agora, chegarei mais cedo. | By leaving now or If I leave now, I’ll get there earlier. |
| --- | --- |
As part of a continuous tense:
| Vou indo bem. | I’m keeping well. |
| --- | --- |
Note that the Portuguese present participle (or gerund) is invariable.

Some past participles are irregular, even when the verb is otherwise regular:

Use
The Portuguese past participle is used in the following ways.
As part of a perfect tense:
| Eles tinham cantado muito bem. | They had sung very well. |
| --- | --- |
| Ela tinha acendido a luz. | She had switched on the light. |
In the passive voice:
| O bolo foi comido. | The cake has been eaten. |
| --- | --- |
| A luz foi acendida por ela. | The light was switched on by her. |
As an adjective:
| A luz está acesa. | The light is (switched) on. |
| --- | --- |
| Estas contas estão pagas. | These bills are paid. |
Where there are two past participles, one regular and one irregular, the former is used for the perfect tenses and is invariable:
| Ela tinha acendido a luz. | She had switched on the light. |
| --- | --- |
| Os pobres animais tinham morrido. | The poor animals had died. |
When used as an adjective or in a passive construction, the past participle must agree in gender and number with the noun to which it relates:
| A loja está aberta. | The shop is open. |
| --- | --- |
| Este livro está bem escrito. | This book is well written. |
| A luz foi acendida por ela. | The light was switched on by her. |
