The infinitive - Easy Learning Grammar Portuguese
 
Portuguese has both an infinitive and a personal infinitive. The former is the way a verb usually appears in a dictionary and means to…, e.g. cantar to sing. The latter takes personal endings, e.g. cantarmos (us) to sing.
 
The infinitive
The dependent infinitive
Some verbs introduce a dependent infinitive directly, without a linking preposition:
conseguir decidir desejar detestar esperar evitar preferir prometer querer recear recusar saber tencionar tentar
| Consegui chegar cedo. | I managed to arrive early. |
| --- | --- |
| Destesto nadar. | I hate swimming. |
| Prefiro ir para a praia. | I prefer going to the beach. |
| Queria comprar um presente para você. | I wanted to buy a present for you. |
The perfect infinitive
The perfect infinitive is formed using an appropriate form of the auxiliary verb ter and the past participle of the verb in question:
| Depois de ter tentado acabar o trabalho hoje, desisti. | After having tried to finish my work today, I gave up. |
| --- | --- |
 
The personal infinitive
The inflected or personal infinitive is formed by the addition of personal endings and is regular for all verbs.
To the appropriate infinitive add the following endings:
| sing. | 1st person |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2nd perspn | -es |
| 2nd, 3rd person |   |
| pl. | 1st person | -mos |
| 2nd person | -(des) |
| 2nd, 3rd person | -em |
| Ele pediu para eu cantar. | He asked (for) me to sing. |
| --- | --- |
| Ele pediu para (nós) cantarmos. | He asked (for) us to sing. |
