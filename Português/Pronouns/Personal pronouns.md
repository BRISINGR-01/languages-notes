Personal pronouns - Easy Learning Grammar Portuguese
 
 
Subject pronouns
|   | singular | plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st person | eu | I | nós | we |
| 2nd person | você
tu | you | vocês
(vós – no longer in general use) | you |
| 3rd person (masc.) (fem.) | ele
ela | he; it
she; it | eles
elas | they
they |
você, tu
In today’s Portuguese, você is a second-person singular subject marker, although it is followed by a verb in the third person. The other subject marker, tu, is the traditional second-person singular subject pronoun. Both você and tu share the same plural, vocês. (For the difference in meaning between você and tu see Tu, você and o senhor / a senhora.)
There is variation in the use of você and tu. In European Portuguese tu is very much alive and well. In Brazil preference is given to você at a national level, but some Brazilian speakers use the subject pronoun tu, often conjugated with the verb ending for você.
| Cecília, você gosta de viajar? | Cecília, do you like travelling? |
| --- | --- |
| Cecília, tu gostas de viajar? (Eur) | Cecília, do you like travelling? |
| Cecília, tu gosta de viajar? (Coll Br) (regionally) | Cecília, do you like travelling? |
vós
The second-person subject pronoun is the plural counterpart of tu in the tu-vós duality inherited from Latin, but it is no longer in general use. You may come across it in specific contexts, e.g. in church.
ele / ela; eles / elas
The form of the third-person subject pronoun reflects not only the number but also the gender of the noun(s) it replaces, this being people, animals or things. With inanimate objects the pronoun tends to be omitted.
| Ela gosta de viajar. | She likes travelling. |
| --- | --- |
| Eles estão deitados no telhado. (os gatos) | They are lying on the roof. (the cats) |
| (Ela) tem quatro pernas. (a mesa) | It has four legs. (the table) |
A masculine plural can refer to both genders:
| Eles gostam de viajar. (Cecília e Eduardo) | They like travelling. (Cecília and Eduardo) |
| --- | --- |
Subject marker omission
Where the verb ending indicates the subject clearly, the subject marker can be dropped:
| (Eu) telefonei ontem. | I phoned yesterday. |
| --- | --- |
| (Nós) vamos à praia amanhã. | We are going to the beach tomorrow. |
 
Direct object pronouns
|   | singular | plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st person | me | me | nos | us |
| 2nd person | o/a
você
te | you | os/as, vos (Eur) (Wr Br)
vocês | you |
| 3rd person (masc.)
(fem.) | o
ele (Coll Br)
a
ela (Coll Br) | him; it
her; it | os
eles (Coll Br)
as
elas (Coll Br) | them
them |
| Eu não te vi. | I didn’t see you. |
| --- | --- |
| Eles não nos viram. | They didn’t see us. |
Particularly in speech, subject-marker words are also often used as direct objects:
| Eles não viram a gente. | They didn’t see us. |
| --- | --- |
| Eu vi você ontem. | I saw you yesterday. |
| Ele levou o senhor de carro? | Did he take you by car? |
Object pronouns after a verb
When object pronouns o(s) / a(s) follow verb forms ending in a nasal sound, they change to no(s) / na(s):
| O trabalho era muito mas eles fizeram-no todo. | There was a lot of work but they did it all. |
| --- | --- |
| As lições eram fáceis. Eles aprenderam-nas bem. | The lessons were easy. They learned them well. |
When object pronouns o(s) / a(s) follow verb forms ending in -r, -s or -z, they change to lo(s) / la(s) and the verb ending also changes:
| Eu vou comprá-lo. (comprar+o) | I am going to buy it. |
| --- | --- |
| Eu não pude ouvi-la. (ouvir+a) | I couldn’t hear her. |
| Ele pô-lo ali. (pôs+o) | He put it there. |
| Você fê-lo. (fez+o) | You did it. |
These constructions are often avoided, particularly in speech, using one of two methods:
by placing the pronoun before the verb
| Muito prazer em conhecê-la. or Muito prazer em a conhecer. | Delighted to meet you. |
| --- | --- |
by using the same words as for subject markers
| Muito prazer em conhecê-la. or Muito prazer em conhecer você. (general) | Delighted to meet you. |
| --- | --- |
| Muito prazer em conhecer a senhora. (courteous) |   |

Indirect object pronouns
|   | singular | plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st person | me | (to) me | nos | (to) us |
| 2nd person | lhe
te
(para) você (Coll Br) | (to) you | lhes
vos (Eur) (Wr Br)
(para) vocês (Coll Br) | (to) you |
| 3rd person
(masc.)
(fem.) | lhe
(para) ele (Coll Br)
lhe
(para) ela (Coll Br) | (to) him; it
(to) her; it | lhes
(para) eles (Coll Br)
lhes
(para) elas (Coll Br) | (to) them
(to) them |
Particularly in speech, indirect objects can also be indicated using subject-marker words preceded by a preposition. This is much more widely heard in Brazil than in Portugal:
| Eu não lhe comprei um presente. or Eu não comprei um presente para ela. | I haven’t bought her a present. |
| --- | --- |
| Você já lhes deu o dinheiro? or Você já deu o dinheiro a eles? | Have you given them the money (yet)? |
| Eu não lhe telefonei ontem. or Eu não telefonei para você ontem. | I didn’t phone you yesterday. |

Combined forms
Indirect-object pronouns can combine and contract with the direct object pronouns o(s) / a(s) in forms such as mo (me+o), to (te+o), lho (lhe+o), etc. Such constructions can be avoided by using a stressed pronoun preceded by a preposition. See Stressed pronouns below.
| Não lho venda. (lhe+o) or Não o venda a ele. | Don’t sell it to him. |
| --- | --- |
| Ele trouxe as chaves e deu-mas. (me+as) or Ele trouxe as chaves e deu-as a mim. | He brought over the keys and gave them to me. |
 
Stressed pronouns
|   | singular | plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st person | para mim | to me | para nós | to us |
| 2nd person | para você, ti
para si (Eur) (Wr Br) | to you | para vocês | to you |
| 3rd person (masc.)
(fem.) | para ele
para ela | to him; it
to her; it | para eles
para elas | to them
to them |
Personal pronouns take a stressed form after a preposition. In some cases, these are the same words as the subject pronouns:
| Eles olharam para nós. | They looked at us. |
| --- | --- |
| Essa carta for escrita por mim. | That letter was written by me. |
| Ela disse a ti que viria? | Did she tell you she would come? |
| Eu fui com eles. | I went with them. |
| Aquilo era para você. = Aquilo era para si. (Eur) (Wr Br) | That was for you. |
The preposition com (with) combines with personal pronouns in the following ways:
| comigo | with me |
| --- | --- |
| contigo | with you |
| connosco (Eur), conosco (Br) | with us |
| consigo (Eur) (Wr Br) = com você | with you |
| convosco (Eur) (Wr Br) = com vocês | with you |
