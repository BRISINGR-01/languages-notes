Word order - Easy Learning Grammar Portuguese
 
In Portuguese, as in English, the usual order in a declarative sentence is subject + verb + complement (where there is one):
| Nós somos amigos. | We’re friends. |
| --- | --- |
| Eu bebi o chá. | I’ve drunk my tea. |
| Ela riu. | She laughed. |
Although a subject generally precedes the verb, in Portuguese the subject pronoun (or other subject marker) can be omitted if it is clear from the context or verb form:
| Somos amigos. | We’re friends. |
| --- | --- |
| Bebi o chá. | I’ve drunk my tea. |
Inversion occurs:
– with verbs that do not take subjects:
| Há lojas perto daqui. | There are shops nearby. |
| --- | --- |
– when the sentence begins with an adverb:
| Aqui estão os livros. | Here are the books. |
| --- | --- |
– in sentences with the se construction:
| Vendem-se carros aqui. | Cars are sold here. |
| --- | --- |
 
Adjectives
Descriptive adjectives generally follow their nouns:
| O lápis preto está em cima da mesa. | The black pencil is on the table. |
| --- | --- |
Some adjectives have different meanings depending on whether they go before or after the noun:
| É um simples exercício. | It is a mere exercise. |
| --- | --- |
| É um exercício simples. | It is an easy exercise. |
| Ele é um homem grande. | He is a big man. |
| --- | --- |
| Ele é um grande homem. | He is a great man. |
Modifiers such as indefinites, possessives, demonstratives, numerals, etc generally precede their nouns:
| Ela preferiu outro vestido. | She liked another dress better. |
| --- | --- |
| O seu chapéu é bonito. | Your hat is pretty. |
| Aquele livro é bom. | That book is good. |
| A menina tem dois gatos. | The little girl has two cats. |
Object pronouns
In a simple declarative sentence, the object pronoun goes before the verb in Brazil, particularly in spoken language, and goes after it in Portugal (linked with a hyphen):
| Ele ajudou-nos. (Eur) (Wr Br) | He helped us. |
| --- | --- |
| Ele nos ajudou. (Coll Br) |   |
| Eles cumprimentaram-me. (Eur) (Wr Br) | They greeted me. |
| Eles me cumprimentaram. (Coll Br) |   |
In other situations, the object pronoun goes before the verb in both Brazil and Portugal. This includes negative and interrogative sentences as well as subordinate clauses:
| Ele não nos ajudou. | He didn’t help us. |
| --- | --- |
| Quando é que você me viu? | When did you see me? |
| Eu vi o homem que te telefonou ontem. | I have seen the man who phoned you yesterday. |
