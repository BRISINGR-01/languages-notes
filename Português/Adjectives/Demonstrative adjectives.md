Demonstrative adjectives - Easy Learning Grammar Portuguese
 
Demonstrative adjectives agree with the noun in both gender (i.e. masc. or fem.) and number (i.e. sing. or plur.):
|   | masculine | feminine |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| singular | este, esse, aquele | estes, esses, aqueles | this; that |
| plural | esta, essa, aquela | estas, essas, aquelas | these; those |
| Este casaco é meu. | This coat is mine. |
| --- | --- |
| Esse guarda-chuva é teu. | That umbrella is yours. |
| Aquelas malas são deles. | Those suitcases are theirs. |
este (and its feminine and plural) indicate something or someone close to the speaker, i.e. to the 1st person.
esse(and its feminine and plural) indicate something or someone close to the listener, i.e. to the 2nd person.
aquele (and its feminine and plural) indicate something or someone at a distance from both the 1st and 2nd persons.
The form aquele translates that and este this, but esse can translate both that and this.
Closeness and distance may refer to space, time or sequence in speech or text.
In Brazil, este is not used much in colloquial speech, leaving esse to cover both meanings:
| Speaker A:   – Esse livro é bom? | – Is that book good? |
| --- | --- |
| Speaker B:   – Sim, este / esse (Coll Br) livro é bom. | –Yes, this book is good. |
