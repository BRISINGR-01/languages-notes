The imperative and alternatives - Easy Learning Grammar Portuguese
 
Some verb forms are used to ask or tell someone to do something. They can also be used to give directions or instructions on how to operate a machine, for instance.
 
Commands, requests and advice
Polite imperative
| Cante! | Coma! | Parta! | talking to one person |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cantem! | Comam! | Partam! | talking to more than one person |
| Sing, (please)! | Eat, (please)! | Leave, (please)! |   |
These forms are borrowed from the present subjunctive and, as such, have an inbuilt element of politeness. However, por favor, meaning please, can always be added on to them, if you want to be even more polite and respectful.
Talking to one person
| Coma, por favor! | Please eat! |
| --- | --- |
| Venha! | Come along, please! |
| Peça agora! | Ask for it now, please! |
| Vá embora! | Go away, please! |
| Abra a janela, por favor! | Please open the window! |
Talking to more than one person
| Comecem! | Start, please! |
| --- | --- |
| Vão embora! | Go away, please! |
| Venham, por favor! | Please come! |
Alternative
| canta | come | parte | talking to one person |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| cantam | comem | partem | talking to more than one person |
| (You) sing | (You) eat | (You) leave |   |
These forms are borrowed from the present (i.e. present indicative) and show the requested or suggested action as a description of what to do. This is heard on both sides of the Atlantic but more so in Brazil.
Talking to one person
| Você parte amanhã, por favor. | You will please leave tomorrow. |
| --- | --- |
| (Você) vira á esquerda na próxima esquina. | (You) turn left at the next corner. |
Talking to more than one person
| Vocês partem amanhã, por favor. | You will please leave tomorrow. |
| --- | --- |
The third person singular ending of the present (the form you would use for someone addressed as você, o senhor or a senhora) just happens to coincide with the tu-ending of the traditional imperative:
| Canta! | Come! | Parte! | talking to one person |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sing! | Eat! | Leave! |   |
This approach gives a familiar tone.
Talking to one person
| Come tudo! | Eat it all! |
| --- | --- |
| Sai daí! | Get out of there! |
| Vai embora! | Go away! |
 
Let’s
The equivalent of the English let’s + infinitive construction is usually vamos + infinitive.
Vamos is also used on its own: Vamos! Let’s go!
| Vamos sair agora! | Let’s leave now! |
| --- | --- |
| Vamos beber alguma coisa! | Let’s have a drink! |
 
Don’t
To ask or tell someone not to do something, use ‘polite’ forms from the present subjunctive:
| Não cantes! | Não comas! | Não partas! | familiar form (singular) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Não cante! | Não coma! | Não parta! | polite form (singular) |
| Não cantem! | Não comam! | Não partam! | talking to more than one person (anyone) |
| Don't sing, (please)! | Don't eat, (please)! | Don't leave, (please)! |   |
See also tu, Tu, você and o senhor / a senhora.
